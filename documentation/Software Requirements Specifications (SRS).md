### DATA STORAGE

The ERM platform will utilize a cloud-based storage solution to ensure scalability, reliability, and performance. The following specifications will be implemented:

1. Database Management System:
   - PostgreSQL 13 or later, hosted on a managed cloud service (e.g., Amazon RDS or Google Cloud SQL)
   - Utilize read replicas for improved performance and failover capabilities

2. Data Retention:
   - Active data: Retained for the duration of the client's subscription plus 30 days
   - Archived data: Retained for 7 years to comply with various regulatory requirements
   - Implement a data lifecycle management policy to automatically archive and delete data based on retention rules

3. Redundancy:
   - Implement multi-region database clusters for high availability
   - Use synchronous replication for critical data to ensure zero data loss in case of failover

4. Backup:
   - Daily automated full backups
   - Continuous incremental backups with point-in-time recovery capability
   - Retain backups for 30 days
   - Regularly test backup restoration process to ensure data integrity

5. Recovery:
   - Implement automated failover mechanisms with a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 5 minutes
   - Maintain a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 1 minute using continuous replication
   - Develop and regularly test a comprehensive Disaster Recovery (DR) plan

6. Scalability:
   - Implement database sharding for organizations with over 1 million risk entries
   - Utilize caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load for frequently accessed data
   - Implement auto-scaling for database resources based on load metrics

### DATA PROCESSING

The ERM platform will implement robust data processing mechanisms to ensure data integrity, security, and efficient operations. The following measures will be put in place:

1. Data Security:
   - Encrypt data at rest using AES-256 encryption
   - Implement TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks
   - Implement row-level security in the database for multi-tenant data isolation
   - Apply data masking for sensitive information in non-production environments

2. Data Validation:
   - Implement server-side input validation for all data entry points
   - Use database constraints to enforce data integrity rules
   - Implement data type checking and sanitization to prevent malformed data

3. Data Transformation:
   - Use ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for bulk data imports
   - Implement data normalization techniques to ensure consistency across the platform

4. Audit Trail:
   - Maintain a comprehensive audit log of all data modifications
   - Store audit logs in a separate, append-only database table

5. Real-time Processing:
   - Implement event-driven architecture using message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) for asynchronous processing of risk assessments and notifications

6. Batch Processing:
   - Schedule nightly batch jobs for data aggregation and report generation
   - Use parallel processing techniques for large-scale data operations

The following data flow diagram illustrates the high-level data processing within the ERM platform:

```mermaid

    A[User Input] --> B[Input Validation]
    B --> C{Valid?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Data Transformation]
    C -->|No| E[Error Handling]

    R -->|No| T[Access Denied]
    S --> U[Data Retrieval]
    U --> V[Data Masking]
    V --> W[API Response]
```

This data flow ensures that all data entering and leaving the system is properly validated, secured, and processed according to the platform's requirements. The combination of real-time and batch processing allows for efficient handling of both immediate user interactions and resource-intensive background tasks.

By implementing these data requirements, the ERM platform will provide a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for managing enterprise risk data across various organizations and industries.
